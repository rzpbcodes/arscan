# ArScan

A static analysis tool for detecting arithmetic issues in Ethereum smart contracts. 

## Features
- ArScan detects the following types of arithmetic issues in Ethereum smart contracts:
  - Integer overflow
  - Integer underflow
  - Divide by zero
  - Precision Loss by Integer Division
  - Signedness issues
  - Truncation

---

### Datasets
- [OpenSCV](https://github.com/blockchain-dei/openscv) is an expert-curated benchmark dataset comprising 146 Solidity smart contracts, each annotated with a specific vulnerability type. It includes both the vulnerable and corresponding corrected versions, enabling precise evaluation of analysis tools in terms of both true positives and false positives.

- [DISL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASSERT-KTH/DISL) is a large-scale dataset, extracted from over 3.2 million verified contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This dataset was used to assess the prevalence of arithmetic issues in real-world smart contracts.

### Tools Used
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSysDiligence/mythril) - Version `v0.24.8`
- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) - Version `v11.0`


### Reports
 - Analysis reports generated by Mythril, Slither, and ArScan on the [OpenSCV](https://github.com/blockchain-dei/openscv) and [DISL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASSERT-KTH/DISL) dataset.
