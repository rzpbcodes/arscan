# ArScan

A static analysis tool for detecting arithmetic issues in Ethereum smart contracts. 

## Features
- Detects common arithmetic issues like:
  - Integer overflow
  - Integer underflow
  - Divide by zero
  - Precision Loss by Integer Division
  - Signedness issues
  - Truncation
- Supports analyzing Solidity files (`.sol`).
- Provides detailed output of potential issues, including impacted code locations and the severity of the issues.
- Easily integrates with existing projects using a virtual environment for dependencies.

### Datasets Used
- [OpenSCV](https://github.com/blockchain-dei/openscv) is an expert-curated benchmark dataset comprising 146 Solidity smart contracts, each annotated with a specific vulnerability type. It includes both the vulnerable and corresponding corrected versions, enabling precise evaluation of analysis tools in terms of both true positives and false positives.

- [DISL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASSERT-KTH/DISL) is a large-scale dataset containing 514,506 deduplicated Solidity source files, extracted from over 3.2 million verified contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This dataset was used to assess the prevalence of arithmetic issues in real-world smart contracts using the six newly developed vulnerability detectors.

### Tools Used
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSysDiligence/mythril) — Version `v0.24.8`
- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) — Version `v11.0`


### Reports
 - Analysis reports generated by Mythril, Slither, and ArScan on the [OpenSCV](https://github.com/blockchain-dei/openscv) and [DISL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASSERT-KTH/DISL) dataset.
